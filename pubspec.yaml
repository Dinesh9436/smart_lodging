# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/download.png
    - assets/logo.png
    - assets/smart-lodging-logo.png
    - assets/declaration.png
    - assets/appyweb.png
    - assets/icon.png
    - assets/app-icon.png
    - assets/Hind-Regular.ttf
    - assets/Kruti-Regular.ttf

    
    

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Audiowide
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Audiowide-Regular.ttf
        
        
    - family: Noto Sans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/NotoSans-Regular.ttf
    
    - family: Hind
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Hind-Regular.ttf

    - family: Kruti
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Kruti-Regular.ttf
